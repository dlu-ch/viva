Viva
====

Johannus Vivaldi is a series of electronic organs.

Unfortunately, these organs lack some important features when it
comes to easy management of registrations (sequencer) and
prominent display of organ state (like position of expression pedals and
current registration).

Viva is a Python program to help organists by providing these possiblilities.
It is meant to run on a laptop, placed on top of the organ and connected to
the organ's MIDI IN input and MIDI SEQ output.

Viva requires

  - an organ of the Johannus Vivaldi series
  - a MIDI interface
  - at least Python 3.6
